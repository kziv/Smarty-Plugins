Smarty Plugins

DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of plugins for the Smarty template engine. Please see each plugin's
documentation for usage and examples.

INSTALLATION

Place whichever plugins you want to use in your smarty/libs/plugins directory. Plugins
can then be called using the standard Smarty syntax.

DEPENDENCIES

All plugins were developed using the Smarty 3.0 engine; however, most, if not all,
should be fine in earlier versions.
